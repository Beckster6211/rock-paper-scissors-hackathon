# rock-paper-scissors-hackathon

## School of Code Week 1 Day 5

### What to do

During School of Code Hackathons are done to exercise what we have learned.

This is what we had to do for the first Hackathon of creating a Rock Paper Scissors game.

This task was to help with using basic HTML and vanilla JS.
It focused on dom manipulation to display the relevate information.

We also had to use functions to generate the computers random move. As well as statements to monitor the scoring generating a response when got to a specific number and the ability to add your name.

### What I did

This isn't actually what I manage to accomplish by the end of that day/week one (I struggled a bit)

Me and my partner manage to get the concept of the game working but only in the console as messages.

I went back to the hackathon on occasion and atleast completed the main concept of it so the results are displayed on the screen (with the dom manipulation).
