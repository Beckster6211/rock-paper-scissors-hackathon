# rock-paper-scissors-hackathon

## School of Code Week 1 Day 5

During School of Code Hackathons are done to exercise what we have learned.

This is what accomplished during the first Hackathon of creating a Rock Paper Scissors game.

This task was to help with using basic HTML and vanilla JS.
It focused on dom manipulation to display the relevate information.

We also had to use functions to generate the computers random move.
